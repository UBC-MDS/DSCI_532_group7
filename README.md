# Movie Rating App 

## Description & sketch

The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution (depending on data type, box chart, scattered plot etc) of dataset factors (runtime, budget, genres, studios, key_word etc.) plotted against vote_average. From a dropdown list, users can filter out variables from the distribution display, by movie genre (i.e. only show horror movies), by studio data (i.e. only show pixar movies), and finally by the runtime range of movies.
