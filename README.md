# MOVIE SELECTION APP

* Description (200-300 words)

{e.g}
The app contains a landing page that shows the distribution (depending on data type, bar chart, density chart etc) of dataset factors (hypertension, physical disabilities etc.) colored coded according to whether patients showed up or didn't show up for an appointment. From a dropdown list, users can filter out variables from the distribution display, by patient demographics (i.e. only show female patients), by appointment data (i.e. if SMS was sent), and finally by the date range of appointments. A different dropdown menu will allow users to re-order variables according to the probability of patients being a no-show or in alphabetical order to comorbidities. Users can compare the distribution of co-morbidities by scrolling down through the app interface
