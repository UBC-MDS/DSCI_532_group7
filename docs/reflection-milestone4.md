# Reflection

_Milestone 4_

_**Group 7**_

## Choice of programming language and plotting library
For this milestone, we chose to use Python over R for the easiness of deployment on heroku. We chose to use Python + plotly to deliver our dashboard for the benefit of flexibility in implementation and fluency in layout designing. 

## What we have implemented
We implemented additional features per TA and peer feedback for our app in this milestone. We migrated our plotting library from altair to plotly. By incorporating the plotly plots, we improved the aesthetics of the app. Moreover, we enabled the click interaction on the studio boxplots to filter the following scatter plot/table by selected studio. This helps complete the story flow and adds complexity to our app. In addition, we added the mean revenue and mean vote average vertical lines in the studio boxplots so that user could compare which studio is doing better or worse than average. We stacked the voting scatter plot and the table so that the app visualizes nice in one full page. We added 2 more summary cards `average profit` and `vote count` so that more numeric summaries are displayed and the app has better aesthetics. We also made other efforts to improve the general aesthetics. 

## What can be improved
We could add more controls on the left sidebar to furture increase the complexity of our app. However, our data do not provide extra dimensionality for us to do this. To complete this, we need to collect more data and incorporate them into our original dataset. Restricted by our time and resource, we decided not to pursue this task. 

## Thoughts on the feedback
We received valuable feedbacks from our TA and peer. Per our TA's and peer's feedback, our app is clean and has good design/flow. It is easy to use and effective in fulfilling its purpose. One feedback that we got both from our TA and peer is that we could add more complexity/functionality to our app. We also received good feedbacks from our peer that we could add a median/mean vertical line to the box plot so that the user could compare the studio's performance vs the average. We were also suggested by our peer to stack the scatter plot and table horiaontally so that the app visualizes nice in one full page. We received the advice on improving the app aesthetics as well. These feedbacks are valuable and pushed us to build a better app. We made effort to address them swiftly.
